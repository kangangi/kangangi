# Hey, I'm Wanjiku 👋🏽

I'm a backend developer who loves clean code, thoughtful architecture, and building systems that actually solve problems.

Right now, I’m:
- 🔧 Improving my skills in cloud, DevOps, and system design
- 🐍 Working mostly with Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and Docker
- 🧠 Learning how to build things that are both simple and scalable

I believe in using tech for good, learning in public, and supporting other women in tech along the way.
